A snapshot of my practical Cybersecurity Experience

Welcome! My name is David this is an introduction and glance of my Cybersecurity Experience.
In the Military, I worked as a Network Admin and later as a manager of a non-internet-connected LAN that dealt with critical infrastructure.
This gave me experience in the Maintenance side of Cybersecurity, like maintenance, updating AV, tracking compliance of machines through 
dashboards, and remediating hosts. This would teach me industry standards like patching, hardening, and the Principle of Least Privilege.
I got certified in Network + and Security + to learn more about the fundamentals of Networking and Cybersecurity.

Since leaving the Military I have been studying Cybersecurity at SANS Technology Institute, and got an associates in IT from California
Institute of Applied Technology. 

Recently, I have just finished my first Capture The Flag event. I participated as an Individual and as a member of a Team that was comprised 
of students from SANS. For all of us, it was actually our first CTF. As an individual, I had made it to the 86th percentile, which puts me in
the top 14%, which was great, and gives me room to improve over time!

While solving the CTF challenges, I was surprised to see how many tools are online to help solve real-world issues. These tools are made for
free, and offered for free and used by both the adversaries and ethical hackers alike. It's also amazing to me the small amount of information
you'd need to reveal a lot, such as two photos and the times they were taken, you could determine where (generally) on earth it was taken! 

I was also shocked to learn my teammates and I scored so in the top 2% of all teams with just the skills we learned at SANS! We made the the 
98th percentile! Most of the skills I used were related to my GIAC Certified Incident Handler Course, proving that the course really teaches 
you practical, demonstrable skills.
